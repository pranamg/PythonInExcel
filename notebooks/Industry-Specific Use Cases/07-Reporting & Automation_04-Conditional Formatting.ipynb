    "\n",
    "Based on [`piplist.txt`](./README.md) output, you should have `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` excel at data analysis, they don't directly control Excel's formatting features. However, Python can identify which data points should be formatted based on complex logic or calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates the following workflow for conditional formatting with Python:\n",
    "1. Load data into Python\n",
    "2. Read formatting parameters from Excel cells\n",
    "3. Apply logic to identify rows meeting formatting criteria\n",
    "4. Add indicator columns (boolean flags) to mark qualifying rows\n",
    "5. Output the enhanced data back to Excel\n",
    "6. Use Excel's conditional formatting features to apply visual styles based on the indicator columns\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach combines Python's analytical power with Excel's formatting capabilities to create visually informative reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will generate dummy data and then write Python code that flags sales records where the `Amount` exceeds a threshold specified in an Excel cell.\n",

    "*   We load the raw sales data (`df`) using `xl()`.\n",

    "*   In **Step 3**, we create a new column named `Flag_HighSales`. This column contains boolean values (`True` or `False`). `df['Amount'] >= sales_threshold` performs the comparison. `df['Amount'].notna()` ensures we only flag non-missing amounts. The `&` operator combines these conditions: a row is flagged as `True` only if the `Amount` is a valid number *and* is greater than or equal to the `sales_threshold`. Otherwise, the flag is `False`.\n",

    "*   Extract the `Full Data with High Sales Flag` DataFrame using `=PY(CellRef[\"Full Data with High Sales Flag\"])` and convert that cell to 'Excel Value' to see the entire dataset including the `Flag_HighSales` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applying Conditional Formatting in Excel:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the `Full Data with High Sales Flag` spilled into your Excel sheet (let's say it's in columns D through H), you can apply conditional formatting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Select the column(s)** you want to format (e.g., select column G which contains the 'Amount').\n",
    "2.  Go to the **Home** tab in Excel, click **Conditional Formatting**, then **New Rule...**.\n",
    "3.  Choose **\"Use a formula to determine which cells to format\"**.\n",
    "4.  Enter a formula that checks the corresponding cell in the `Flag_HighSales` column. If your data starts in row 2, and the `Flag_HighSales` column is column H, the formula would be `=H2=TRUE`. Make sure to use absolute reference (`$H2`) if you want the rule to apply based on the flag column, but only apply the formatting to the selected column (G). If you want to highlight the *entire row* where the flag is TRUE, select the entire range (e.g., D2:H1000) and the formula would be `=$H2=TRUE`.\n",
    "5.  Click the **Format...** button and choose your desired formatting (e.g., fill color, font color).\n",
    "6.  Click **OK** twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, any row where the `Flag_HighSales` column is `TRUE` (meaning the Amount met your parameterized threshold) will have the specified conditional formatting applied in Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To update the formatting:** Change the threshold value in your Excel cell (`A1`) and **re-run the Python cell** (Ctrl+Enter). The `Flag_HighSales` column in your Python output will update, and because your Excel conditional formatting rule points to this column, the formatting on your data will also update automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "This integration of Python logic with Excel's formatting features creates dynamic, visually rich reports that automatically update when parameters change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some advanced conditional formatting techniques you could apply to this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex Formatting Rules:**\n",
    "   - Implement multi-condition formatting logic\n",
    "   - Create dynamic threshold calculations\n",
    "   - Design hierarchical formatting rules\n",

    "2. **Statistical Formatting:**\n",
    "   - Highlight statistical outliers\n",
    "   - Format based on z-scores or percentiles\n",
    "   - Implement moving average thresholds\n",

    "3. **Time-based Formatting:**\n",
    "   - Create rolling window comparisons\n",
    "   - Highlight seasonal patterns\n",
