    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   We load the `CustomerInfo` and `OrderHistory` DataFrames using `xl()`. **Remember to replace the source names.**\n",
    "*   We ensure the `CustomerID` column in both DataFrames is treated as a string type, which is good practice for join keys to avoid unexpected behavior. We also clean up other column types.\n",
    "*   `pd.merge()` is the core function used for joining DataFrames based on one or more common columns (`on='CustomerID'`).\n",
    "*   `how='inner'` performs an inner join: it keeps only rows where the `CustomerID` is present in *both* `df_customers` and `df_orders`.\n",
    "*   `how='left'` performs a left join: it keeps all rows from `df_customers` (the \"left\" DataFrame) and brings in matching rows from `df_orders`. If a `CustomerID` from `df_customers` doesn't appear in `df_orders`, the columns from `df_orders` will show `NaN` (Not a Number) for that row.\n",
    "*   A note about `pd.concat()` is included to mention its use for stacking DataFrames that have a similar column structure (like combining yearly datasets).\n",
    "*   We return a dictionary containing the heads and shapes of the resulting merged DataFrames, plus the note.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Viewing the Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Click the Python cell, then click the Python icon/button next to the formula bar.\n",
    "*   Select \"Excel Value\" (**Ctrl+Shift+Alt+M**) for the DataFrames within the output dictionary to spill them into your sheet. This will show the first few rows and the dimensions of the integrated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting merged DataFrames (`df_inner_merged`, `df_left_merged`) combine the customer information with their order details, enabling advanced analytics such as calculating total customer spending and analyzing order frequency based on demographics. The next topic in the series is [\"Data Cleaning & Preparation - 4. Data Reshaping\"](./03-Data%20Cleaning%20&%20Preparation_04-Data%20Reshaping.md), which explores techniques for restructuring data layouts to support different analysis requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Analysis:**\n",
    "* **Advanced Join Operations:** Implementing complex multi-key joins, fuzzy matching for imperfect keys, or rolling joins for time-series data\n",
    "* **Data Reconciliation:** Building automated validation checks to ensure data consistency post-integration\n",
    "* **Entity Resolution:** Using machine learning techniques to match records across datasets without exact keys\n",
    "* **Schema Evolution:** Handling changes in data structure over time with dynamic schema mapping\n",
