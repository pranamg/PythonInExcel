    "Regression analysis is a powerful predictive modeling technique used to forecast continuous target variables (numbers that can take any value within a range), such as house prices, sales revenue, temperature, or test scores. This approach builds mathematical models that capture relationships between input features (independent variables) and a continuous target variable (dependent variable).\n",

    "\n",
    "*   We load the dummy regression data. **Remember to replace `\"RegressionData\"`**.\n",
    "*   We ensure numerical columns are correctly typed, coercing errors to `NaN`.\n",
    "*   **Data Preparation:**\n",
    "    *   Rows with missing `Target_Score` are removed because they cannot be used for training or evaluation.\n",
    "    *   The data is split into features (X) and target (Y).\n",
    "    *   Missing values in the features (X) are handled using `SimpleImputer` with a median strategy. **Note:** For production-level code, imputation should ideally be done within a pipeline or after splitting the data to avoid data leakage from the test set into the training set's imputation statistics. This simplified example imputes before splitting for ease of demonstration in a single cell.\n",
    "    *   `train_test_split` divides the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the unseen testing data to assess its generalization performance. `random_state` ensures the split is the same each time you run the code.\n",
    "*   **Model Training:** A `LinearRegression` model from `sklearn.linear_model` is initialized and trained (`.fit()`) on the training data (`X_train`, `Y_train`).\n",
    "*   **Prediction:** The trained model is used to predict `Target_Score` values for the test set features (`X_test`) using `.predict()`.\n",
    "*   **Model Evaluation:** Standard metrics (`mean_absolute_error`, `mean_squared_error`, `r2_score`) are calculated by comparing the model's predictions (`Y_pred`) to the actual values from the test set (`Y_test`). These metrics quantify how well the model performed. MAE and RMSE are measures of prediction error in the original units of the target variable; R-squared indicates the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the features.\n",
    "*   Model coefficients and the intercept are extracted to show the linear equation the model learned (e.g., `Target_Score = intercept + coef1*Feature1 + coef2*Feature2 + ...`).\n",
    "*   **Visualization:**\n",
    "    *   `fig1`: A scatter plot compares the actual `Target_Score` values from the test set against the model's predicted values. Points close to the diagonal line indicate good predictions.\n",
    "    *   `fig2`: An optional scatter plot shows the relationship between the `Target_Score` and one of the predictor features (`Feature1_StudyHours`). The regression line for this single feature relationship (derived from the multi-feature model's intercept and that feature's coefficient) is overlaid to visualize the model's learned linear trend for that specific feature.\n",
    "*   **Custom Style:** Applied the specified style guidelines (font, colors - blue for actual vs predicted, salmon dashed for perfect line, purple for scatter points, orange for regression line, off-black for text/axes, axes, spines, grid).\n",
