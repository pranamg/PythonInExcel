    "*   We load the dummy geospatial data. **Remember to replace `\"GeospatialData\"`**.\n",
    "*   We ensure numerical columns are correctly typed, coercing errors to `NaN`.\n",
    "*   We drop rows with missing `Latitude` or `Longitude` since these points cannot be placed on the plot.\n",
    "*   We handle potential outliers in `CustomerSpending` by capping values at the 95th percentile before using them for point sizing. This prevents a few extreme values from making other points too small to see.\n",
    "*   We scale the capped spending values to map them to a reasonable range of marker sizes using a linear scaling formula.\n",
    "*   **Style Guidelines:** Global style parameters are set using `rcParams` and `seaborn.set_theme()`.\n",
    "*   **Geographic Scatter Plot:**\n",
    "    *   `seaborn.scatterplot()` is used. We map `Longitude` to the x-axis and `Latitude` to the y-axis, which is standard for geographic coordinates.\n",
    "    *   `size='Marker_Size'` tells seaborn to vary the point size based on the `Marker_Size` column we created (derived from `CustomerSpending`). `sizes=(min, max)` specifies the minimum and maximum marker sizes to use.\n",
    "    *   Applied teal color (`#27acaa`) with some transparency (`alpha`), title, labels, spines, and turned off the grid.\n",
    "*   **Limitations Note:** The code includes a print statement outlining the limitations of this plot compared to true geospatial visualization tools due to the available libraries. This is important for setting user expectations. A DataFrame containing this note is also included in the output dictionary.\n",
