    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   We load the dummy data using `xl()`. **Remember to replace `\"RelationshipData\"`**.\n",
    "*   We ensure numerical columns are correctly typed and handle missing values in categorical columns explicitly.\n",
    "*   **Style Guidelines:** We set Matplotlib's `rcParams` and `seaborn.set_theme()` for styling. Grid is turned off globally, then specific adjustments are made per plot.\n",
    "*   **Scatter Plot:**\n",
    "    *   We filter out rows with NaNs in the columns needed for this plot (`Feature_A`, `Feature_B`, `Group`).\n",
    "    *   `seaborn.scatterplot()` is used, mapping `Feature_A` to x and `Feature_B` to y. `hue='Group'` colors the points based on the categorical variable, allowing visual inspection of whether the relationship differs across groups.\n",
    "    *   Applied blue, yellow, and off-black colors from the guidelines for the different groups using `palette`. Title, labels, spines applied.\n",
    "*   **Pair Plot:**\n",
    "    *   We drop rows with NaNs in any of the selected numerical columns as `pairplot` often requires this.\n",
    "    *   `seaborn.PairGrid()` is used to set up the grid structure for pairwise plots. We map different plot types to the upper triangle (scatter), lower triangle (KDE contours), and diagonal (histograms with KDE).\n",
    "    *   Applied global style settings and manually adjusted plot title and removed grids/despined axes after creation. Pair plots are excellent for getting a quick overview of relationships and distributions for multiple numerical variables simultaneously.\n",
    "*   **Correlation Heatmap:**\n",
    "    *   We calculate the pairwise Pearson correlation matrix using `.corr()` on the numerical columns after dropping rows with NaNs.\n",
    "    *   `seaborn.heatmap()` is used to visualize the matrix. The color intensity represents the correlation coefficient (-1 to +1). `annot=True` displays the correlation values on the heatmap. A diverging colormap (`coolwarm`) is used, which is standard for correlations (showing strong positive vs. strong negative).\n",
    "    *   Applied title, adjusted tick label size/rotation for readability, and removed unnecessary spines.\n",
    "*   We return a dictionary containing the three Matplotlib figure objects and the correlation matrix values as a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Viewing the Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Click the Python cell, then click the Python icon/button next to the formula bar.\n",
    "*   Select \"Excel Value\" (**Ctrl+Shift+Alt+M**) for the DataFrame ('Correlation_Matrix_Values') to spill it into your sheet.\n",
    "*   For each plot figure object ('FeatureA_vs_FeatureB_Scatter_Plot', 'Pairwise_Relationships_Plot', 'Correlation_Heatmap'), select \"Picture in Cell\" > \"Create Reference\" to see the plots spilled into your worksheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "These relationship plots provide powerful visual tools for exploring bivariate and multivariate relationships within your data, helping identify patterns, correlations, and potential insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some advanced relationship visualization techniques you could apply to this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Advanced Correlation Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Implement non-linear correlation measures (Spearman, Kendall)\n",
    "   - Create hierarchical correlation clusters\n",
    "   - Visualize partial correlations controlling for specific variables\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interactive Relationship Exploration:**\n",
    "   - Create linked brushing plots for relationship exploration\n",
    "   - Implement dynamic filtering by variable ranges\n",
    "   - Add zoom capabilities for dense scatter plots\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-dimensional Visualization:**\n",
    "   - Create 3D scatter plots for three-variable relationships\n",
    "   - Implement parallel coordinates plots\n",
    "   - Use bubble plots with size encoding additional variables\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time-based Relationship Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Visualize how relationships evolve over time\n",
    "   - Create animated relationship plots\n",
    "   - Implement rolling correlation windows\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Advanced Pattern Detection:**\n",
    "   - Add regression lines with confidence bands\n",
    "   - Implement LOWESS smoothing for non-linear relationships\n",
    "   - Visualize clusters and outliers in relationship context\n",
    "\n",
    "The next topic in the series is [Visualization - Composition Plots (Pie, Stacked Bar)](./06-Visualization_04-Composition%20Plots%20(Pie,%20Stacked%20Bar)..md), which explores techniques for visualizing part-to-whole relationships."
