    "*   We prepare the data for Market Basket Analysis by transforming it into a one-hot encoded format where each row is an order and columns represent whether a product was in that order.\n",
    "*   We use `mlxtend`'s `apriori` algorithm to find frequent itemsets (combinations of products bought together often) and `association_rules` to derive rules like \"customers who bought X also bought Y\". We filter and sort the rules by 'confidence' and 'lift'.\n",

    "    *   `fig1`: A line plot showing the monthly total sales trend over time.\n",
    "    *   `fig2`: A bar chart showing the total sales contributed by each product category.\n",
    "    *   `fig3`: A plot showing the distribution of customer spending, colored by their assigned cluster from the K-Means analysis. Using `swarmplot` helps visualize individual points for a small number of clusters.\n",
    "*   **Custom Style:** Applied the specified style guidelines (font, colors, axes, spines, grid). Data labels are added to the bar chart.\n",
