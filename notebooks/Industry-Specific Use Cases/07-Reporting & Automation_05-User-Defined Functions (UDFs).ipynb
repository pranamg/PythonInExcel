    "\n",
    "User-Defined Functions (UDFs) extend Excel's capabilities by creating custom Python functions that work like native Excel functions such as `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, or `VLOOKUP`. These functions enable complex calculations and custom logic to be embedded directly in your spreadsheet formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create UDFs in Python for Excel, define functions within a `=PY()` cell and call them using Excel cell references or table names through the `xl()` function. For example, a formula might look like `=PY(MY_PYTHON_FUNCTION(xl(\"A1\"), xl(\"MyTable[#All]\" , headers=True)))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use this approach, the formula in Excel will look like `=PY(MY_PYTHON_FUNCTION(xl(\"A1\"), xl(\"MyTable[#All]\" , headers=True)))`. The Python code within the `=PY()` cell defines `MY_PYTHON_FUNCTION`.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   We define standard Python functions (`CONVERTTOCELSIUS`, `GETAVERAGESALES`).\n",
    "*   These functions reside within a single `=PY()` cell. When this cell is executed, the functions are defined in the Python session associated with your workbook.\n",
    "*   The docstrings still provide helpful information.\n",
    "*   Error handling is included within the functions to manage invalid inputs or data issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Use the Custom Functions from Other `=PY()` Cells in Excel**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the functions are defined in the Python session (by running the `=PY()` cell in Step 2), you can call them from *other* `=PY()` cells in your worksheet. You pass the Excel cell or range/Table you want to use as input *into* the `xl()` function, and then pass the result of `xl()` to your Python function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **For `CONVERTTOCELSIUS`:**\n",
    "    *  Type a Fahrenheit temperature in a cell, say `C1` (e.g., `75`).\n",
    "    *  In another cell, say `C2`, type the formula `=PY( CONVERTTOCELSIUS(xl(\"C1\")) )`.\n",
    "    *  Press **Ctrl+Enter**. The cell `C2` should show the Celsius equivalent (23.89).\n",
    "    *  Change the value in `C1` and re-run the `C2` cell (Ctrl+Enter). It will recalculate.\n",
    "    *  Try entering non-numeric text in `C1` and re-run `C2`. `C2` should show \"Invalid Input\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **For `GETAVERAGESALES`:**\n",
    "    *  Ensure your dummy sales data from Step 1 is in a range or Table named `UDFSalesData` (or whatever name you used).\n",
    "    *   In a new cell, type the formula `=PY( GETAVERAGESALES(xl(\"UDFSalesData[#All]\", headers=True)) )`.\n",
    "    *  Press **Ctrl+Enter**. The cell should display the calculated average sales amount from the 'Amount' column of your dummy data.\n",
    "    *  If you change amounts in your `UDFSalesData` table and re-run the cell with the formula (Ctrl+Enter), the result should update.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes on UDFs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Recalculation:** Python UDFs recalculate whenever their input cells change or the sheet is recalculated.\n",
    "*   **Performance:** Complex calculations on large datasets within a UDF can make your spreadsheet slow, as Excel waits for Python to return a result. For heavy analysis, it's often better to use a standard `=PY(...)` block to perform the analysis once and spill the results, rather than having many UDF calls throughout the sheet.\n",
    "*   **Side Effects:** UDFs are designed to return a value to the cell they are in. They should *not* be used to modify other cells, open files, or perform other actions with side effects.\n",
    "*   **Errors:** If a UDF encounters a Python error, the cell will typically show `#VALUE!`. You can right-click the cell and select \"Show Error Details...\" to see the Python traceback and debug.\n",
    "*   **Availability:** The UDFs are available in the workbook as long as the Python session initiated by the `=PY` cell containing the definition is active.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some advanced UDF development techniques you could explore:\n",
    "\n",
