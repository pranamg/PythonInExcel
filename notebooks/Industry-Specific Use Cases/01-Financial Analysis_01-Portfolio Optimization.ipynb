    "\n",
    "Portfolio optimization is a critical financial analysis technique that analyzes the performance and risk of a collection of assets (a portfolio) to determine the optimal combination that maximizes return for a given level of risk, or minimizes risk for a given level of return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on [`piplist.txt`](./README.md) output, you should have the necessary libraries like `pandas` for data handling, `numpy` for numerical operations, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization, and `scipy` which can be used for optimization tasks (though a full optimization routine is quite involved, we can demonstrate key steps like calculating returns, volatility, and covariance).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Generate Sample Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create dummy historical daily stock price data for a few assets. We can use `pandas` and `numpy` for this. `Faker` isn't typically used for generating quantitative time series data like stock prices, so we'll rely on `numpy`'s random functions and `pandas` for date indexing.\n",

    "   - Implement the full Markowitz optimization\n",
    "   - Calculate the optimal portfolio weights\n",
    "   - Plot the efficient frontier curve\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Risk-Adjusted Performance Metrics:**\n",
    "   - Calculate Sharpe Ratio and Sortino Ratio\n",
    "   - Implement Value at Risk (VaR) analysis\n",
    "   - Add Maximum Drawdown calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced Portfolio Constraints:**\n",
    "   - Add sector allocation constraints\n",
    "   - Implement transaction cost modeling\n",
    "   - Design rebalancing strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Alternative Risk Measures:**\n",
    "   - Calculate downside deviation\n",
    "   - Implement CVaR/Expected Shortfall\n",
    "   - Add tail risk analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Portfolio Stress Testing:**\n",
    "   - Implement Monte Carlo simulations\n",
    "   - Add scenario analysis capabilities\n",
    "   - Create risk factor sensitivity tests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the full efficient frontier requires optimization techniques (typically using `scipy.optimize.minimize`). While `scipy` is available, setting up the optimization problem (defining objective function, constraints) is more involved than a simple code block. The calculations we've done (returns, volatility, covariance) are the essential first steps.\n",
