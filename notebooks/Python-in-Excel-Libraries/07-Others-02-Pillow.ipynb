    "- **Performance**: Preload images and limit canvas sizes in Python cells to keep workbook performance responsive.\n",
    "- **Automation**: Combine Pillow operations with `xl()` references to network–driven data tables, enabling dynamic image generation whenever underlying Excel data changes.\n",
